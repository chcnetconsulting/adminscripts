What does it do?

It downloads from php downloads the respective tar packages, unpacks it, and 
configures it with almost all features. 

!! You will need to install build essentials and all necessary dev libraries,
otherwise this will not work!!

Currently prepared scripts vor php 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6

This favours a layout, where all php versions are under /opt/php-X.y, where
x is the major number and y the minor. 

5.6, e.g. This does not support several versions like 5.4.1, 5.4.2, etc, 
as all new builds
